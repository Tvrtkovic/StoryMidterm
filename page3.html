				<p> When Elon recieved this letter he immediately called the president Gianni himself. The two debated over the phone on who was the true goat of soccer, but there was only one way to find out. Elon Musk invited both Ronaldo and Messi to 1v1 in a classic soccer match, when the two got the invitation they both accepted and flew there way over to Elon. Upon arriving, Elon had already built a multi billionare dollar soccer field filled with fans from around the globe. Both Ronaldo and Messi looked at each other and knew that this would be the most incredible soccer match of all time. They both put on there uniforms putting pride on Argentina and Portugal and got ready to play.</p>
